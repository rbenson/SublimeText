# Orgmode Hacks

[Org Mode][OM] is a package made for emacs. [Daniel Magnusson][dm] ported orgmoode to a [Sublime Text package][stp].

I have customized it some to fit my prefences.

## Mods I have done:

- Add support for `#` as a headline alongside the default `*`;
- Slight tweaks to the theme;
- Added support in `GoTo Symbol` for:
  - headlines, 
  - breaks, 
  - pages

I will update as I add things, and contribute to the main branch as I go along.
