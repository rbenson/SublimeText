# Orgmode Hacks

[Org Mode][OM] is a package made for emacs. [Daniel Magnusson][dm] ported orgmoode to a [Sublime Text package][stp].

I have customized it some to fit my prefences.

## Mods I have done:

- Headlines:
  - pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, then <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> allows tags to be assigned to the headline
  - Added capturing indented headlines, so children will fold with parents
- Tweaks to the theme, by adding:
  - Deadlines
  - Scheduled (due date)
  - Modified look and behavior of headlines
- Added support in `GoTo Symbol` for:
  - headlines, 
  - breaks, 
  - pages

## Current look of Orgmode with mods

I will update as I add things, and contribute to the main branch as I go along.
